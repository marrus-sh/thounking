#  Out-of-Body Tags

>   (The specification begins with the section titled "Definitions". The preceding sections are purely informative.)

##  Introduction:

This is an informal proposal for out-of-body (OoB) [hash]tag support for Mastodon (and similar AP services). By “out-of-body hashtags” I mean tags which:

- Are not a part of the post body, and
- Still function like a hashtag normally would:
    - If posts under a normal (“embodied”) hashtag would normally be browsable in a hashtag timeline, posts under an OoB tag should as well.
    - If posts under an embodied hashtag would normally be muteäble based on the hashtag's content, the same should be true for OoB tag.

However, not all of the same restrictions apply to OoB tags that apply to normal, embodied ones:

- An OoB tag isn't being intermixed with text content, so there is no need to limit its character set to only include certain characters.

The OoB tag model is akin to that already used in some (non-AP) social media sites; eg. Tumblr.

##  Reasoning:

The reasons behind having OoB tags basically boil down to the following two points:

1.  Hashtags within the body of posts have their place, but are unsightly in a lot of applications—meaning that people don't use them as often as they should.
2.  OoB tags provide a way of indicating the content of a post in a more comprehensive manner than existing tools (eg., CWs, which are intended as *generalized non-searchable summaries* and not *specific searchable metadata*).

It is my hope that having support for OoB tags will pave the way for other features as well, like hashtag muting.

##  Purpose and Scope:

This is an informal specification and the conformance requirements are intentionally broad.
A number of things are not specified.
The goal of this document is to put forward a simple set of requirements by which sites like Mastodon can more easily implement something approaching an OoB tag feature.

Most significantly, it defines a fallback mechanism for federating out OoB tags to non-conforming servers via a `data--oo-b_tags` property.
This property should be ignored by Mastodon as-is, displaying the fallback content.

The `as:Hashtag` object type is (to my knowledge) not presently well-defined.
So, this document lays down some basic rules regarding the processing and handling of hashtags, which are optional except for those tags which a server decides are OoB.
Whether these requirements will be adopted for hashtags in general will be up to whoever decides upon a more formal `as:Hashtag` specification.
However, specifying a hashtag type without *any* processing guidelines seemed folly.

Requirements for clients are not made, as they depend on the specific mechanisms by which a client interacts with a server and also its UX constraints.
For sites like Mastodon, it would be reasonable to only show OoB tags in the detailed view of a status.

##  Definitions:

The `as:` prefix refers to the [ActivityStreams vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/), `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#`.

- __Code points__ are [Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/) code points.
- __Surrogates__ are [Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/) surrogate code points.
- __Characters__ are [Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/) scalar values (code points that are not surrogates).
- __Control codes__ are characters with a `General_Category` property value of `Cc`.
- The __whitespace characters__ are characters which have a Unicode `White_Space` property.
- An __OoB tag__ is an [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) object which is treated in the manner specified by this specification.
- An __OoB tag name__ is the value of the `as:name` property on an OoB tag.
- A __conforming implementation__ is a server which meets the conformance requirements defined below.

##  Conformance Requirements:

An implementation is conforming if it meets all of the normative requirements set forth by this specification.
Every section, starting with the section titled "Definitions" and continuing to the end of this document, is normative.
All previous sections are non-normative.
Additionally, all text set in blockquotes (like the following paragraph) is non-normative, as are all blocks of code.

>    This paragraph is non-normative.

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", " **SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119). 

Conforming implementations **MUST** conform to the [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) specification.

Should a specification for the `as:Hashtag` object type merit approval as an extension (and reach publication at <https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#extensions>), conforming implementations **MUST** also conform to such a specification.
If said specification contradicts anything in this document, the conformance rules set forward by the `as:Hashtag` specification **MUST** be followed instead of the ones set forward in this document, up to the extent where such a contradiction is resolved.
In the unfortunate situation that the specifications are irreconcilably different, a new specification for OoB tags will have to be written.

This specification sets forth a number of general requirements and suggestions for servers regarding the handling of OoB tags. Requirements which are labelled with the phrase "on sending" need only be followed by servers when *publishing* OoB tag objects in an [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) format. Similarly, requirements which are labelled with the phrase "on receiving" need only be followed by servers when *receiving* and *processing* OoB objects in an [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) format. All other requirements **MUST** be followed by servers regardless of context.

##  Specification:

###  The OoB Tag object.

OoB tags are [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) objects.
The `@type` of these objects **MUST** be `as:Hashtag`.

OoB tags are designed to be used with the `as:tag` property of [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) `Object`s, but more specific requirements regarding its use are not made.

>   The definition for `as:Hashtag` has (at time of writing) not yet been standardized.
>   The current implementation used by the social networking software Mastodon specifies at least the following two properties: `as:href` and `as:name`.
>    This suggests that `as:Hashtag` will probably be an extension of `as:Link`.
>    This specification specifies requirements for the `as:name` property, but makes no requirements regarding `as:href`.

>    If the eventual specification of `as:Hashtag` is fundamentally incompatible with the requirements set forth by this document, a new `@type` for OoB tags will need to be introduced via revision to this specification.

Only those `as:Hashtag`s which an implementation determines are not a part of an object's main content need to conform to the requirements set forth in this specification. Other ("embodied") `as:Hashtag`s might have different requirements.
Conforming implementations __SHOULD__ assume every `as:Hashtag` is an OoB tag unless given evidence to the contrary (for example, by detecting a matching link inside the `content` attribute of an object), however, the mechanisms by which this determination is made are not specified here.

>    There are no requirements in this specification that a conforming implementation treat *any* `as:Hashtag` as an OoB tag.
>    The OoB tag mechanism is intended as a minimal fallback for `as:Hashtag`s which are not already being rendered through other means.
>    However, other specifications may set forward requirements regarding tag interpretation which reference the requirements put forward here.

###  Tag name syntax and storage.

Every OoB tag **MUST** have a property with the name `as:name`.
The value of this property **SHOULD** be a human-readable identifier for the OoB tag.

OoB tag names are sequences of code points (strings).

On sending, implementations **MUST NOT** send OoB tags which contain surrogates or control codes.

On receiving, implementations **MAY**, at their discretion, replace any surrogates or control codes in an OoB tag with `U+FFFD � REPLACEMENT CHARACTER`.
This provision notwithstanding, on receiving, implementations **MUST** otherwise store OoB tags verbatim.

On sending an OoB tag which was previously received from another source, implementations **MUST NOT** change the value of the tag from the stored value, as defined above.

###  Normalization of tags.

OoB tags **SHOULD** be normalized before performing operations on them. Some possible (non-normative) operations are as follows:

- List operations which depend on the tag (placing objects into lists, displaying a list for a given tag value).
- Rendering operations, including serializing tags for clients.
- Searching operations, including searching for an object with a given tag.
- Hiding operations; for example, hiding all objects with a given tag.

At minimum, implementations **SHOULD** perform the following (normative) operations when normalizing tags:

- Remove any sequences of whitespace characters which begin or end the tag.
- Replace every other contiguous sequence of whitespace characters with a single `U+0020 SPACE` character.
- Perform case folding on the tag according to the equivalences established in [Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/)'s [CaseFolding.txt](http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/CaseFolding.txt)

The following ruby code provides a sample implementation (requires Ruby 2.4.0 or later):

```rb
def normalize_OoB_tag (tag)
  tag.gsub(/^[[:space:]]+|[[:space:]]+$/, '').gsub(/[[:space:]]+/, ' ').downcase(:fold)
end
```

Implementations **MAY** apply additional normalization to tags—for example, by replacing composed characters with base characters.

###  Client interactions.

Some conforming implementations **MAY** make the stored value of [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) data available to clients in a non-[ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) format; for example through an implementation-specific API.
When doing so, OoB tags **SHOULD** be provided in a manner equivalent to all other `as:Hashtag`s in all situations where doing so does not otherwise change the meaning of the content.

>    For example, suppose an implementation has an API which provides information on all of the `as:Hashtag`s associated with an object as an array.
>    Such an implementation shouldn't strip OoB tags from this array; rather, they should be listed alongside the other `as:Hashtag` objects.

###  Fallback inclusion in object content.

In order to make OoB tags available visible to non-conforming servers, conforming implementations **MAY** include a list of tags within the `content` of a parent [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) `Object`.
For implementations which present this content using (X)HTML, it is **RECOMMENDED** that the list of tags be wrapped in an element whose `data--oo-b_tags` attribute is present.

```html
<p>This is an example post!!<p>
<p data--oo-b_tags># First example tag	# Second tag</p>
```

The value of this attribute **SHOULD** be ignored.
Conforming implementations **SHOULD** strip *any* elements with a `data--oo-b_tags` attribute from the `content` of objects before sending it to clients (regardless of where the object originated from).

>   The `data--oo-b_tags` attribute is intentionally unwieldy and intended as a stopgap measure until better mechanisms for determining content based on implementation support are devised.

####  > Formatting

This specification makes no requirements as to the formatting of fallback tag content. Furthermore, although fallback tag content **SHOULD** meaningfully represent the original OoB tags, a conforming implementation **MAY** make any number of modifications—for example by replacing spaces with underscores. The following are all possible fallback representations for the OoB tags `awoo`, `first post`, and `gameïng`:

```html
<p data--oo-b_tags>#awoo #firstpost #gameng  <!--  Removing spaces and non-ASCII characters  -->
<p data--oo-b_tags>#awoo #first_post #gameïng  <!--  Replacing spaces with underscores  -->
<p data--oo-b_tags>Tags: awoo, first post, gameïng  <!--  Creating a human-readable list -->
```

Additional HTML formatting **MAY** also be applied:

```html
<p data--oo-b_tags rel="as:tag" inlist>
    <span typeof="as:Hashtag">
        <a href="https://myinstance.social/tag/awoo" property="as:href">
            <span content="awoo" property="as:name">#awoo</span>
        </a>
    </span>
    <span typeof="as:Hashtag">
        <a href="https://myinstance.social/tag/first%20post" property="as:href">
            <span content="first post" property="as:name">#first post</span>
        </a>
    </span>
    <span typeof="as:Hashtag">
        <a href="https://myinstance.social/tag/gameïng" property="as:href">
            <span content="gameïng" property="as:name">#gameïng</span>
        </a>
    </span>
</p>
```

##  Privacy Concerns:

`as:Hashtags` are commonly made searchable by servers, and implementors **SHOULD** consider the consequences of this when designing their implementations, and **SHOULD** communicate this fact to users.

##  Security Concerns:

There are no security-related concerns introduced by this specification that aren't a part of [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) proper.
